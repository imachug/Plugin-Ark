# Ark

This is Ark plugin for the wonderful [ZeroNet](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet) project.


## Why?

Focusing on Bitcoin only isn't a good idea. Let's bring more! Ark is only the first alternative crypto to be added. In future, other cryptographies can be added via a simple plugin-like system.


## How to install

1. Checkout `py3-ark` branch of ZeroNet repository.
2. Fetch submodules:
```
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```
3. Install requirements:
```
$ pip install -r plugins/Ark/requirements.txt
```


## How do I switch to Ark?

No problem! Since this moment, you can choose what cryptography to use at the moment of site creation (and site cloning as well).
